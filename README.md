## 📖 Description

### What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase and collaborate with others. It works locally on your machine and ensures that every change made is recorded.

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides tools for code sharing, collaboration, versioning, code review, and continuous integration/deployment.

- Push code changes to a central repo
- Use branches to develop features independently
- Create pull requests for code review
- Merge code safely after approval
